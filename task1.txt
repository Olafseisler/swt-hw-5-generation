Discussion:
While manually written tests (MTv1) are very few compared to the automatically generated ones (GTv1),
they find faults that the generated ones do not. This happens despite the fact that the MTv1 only has
66% line coverage and 55% branch coverage, while GTv1 has 88% line coverage and 93% branch coverage.
See images in the folder Screenshots.
It is obvious that manually writing tests are thougt through more and take into account knowledge about
the domain and thus additional boundary values.

After creating NDv2 by including the leap year functionality, we ran the tests in MTv1 and GTv12.
As expected, the line and branch coverage for both test suites have decreased, compared to running the tests
on NextDate version NDv1, which had fewer lines of code.
All 4 of the MTv1 tests now pass but GTv12 now has 1 failed test (out of 23):
the test "testRunReturningNonEmptyString" previously considered the output value "3/1/2000" to be valid,
which of course is not correct for the leap year date "2/28/2000", and now it flags the test as having failed.
It is obvious we need to generate a new test suite to take the added functionality into account.

// The instructions didn't mention whether we should correct this test or not,
// so we decided it makes more sense to not correct it and keep it for the comparison in the next step.

The new test suite GTv2 has higher line and branch coverage than the suite GTv12:
line coverage is 6% higher and branch coverage is 2% higher. There are also a few more tests and none of the tests fail.
GTv2 covers the equivalence classes EC1, EC2, EC3, EC4, EC5, EC6, EC7, EC8, EC9, EC10, EC11 - same as GTv12,
but there is actually an improvement: GTv12 marks more incorrect outputs (EC11) as valid, while GTv2 continues
with marking only the incorrectly calculated July's dates as valid (courtesy of faulty code in the NextDate.java).

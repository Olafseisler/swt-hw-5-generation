2.1
After correcting the line that contained the fault causing the failure of "testDecemberToJanuary" in task 1
as instructed, the number of passed and failed tests remain the same:
GTv1 Verdict: Pass: 22/22;
MTv1 Verdict: Pass: 2/4.
However, the actual output value of the failure in "testDecemberToJanuary" changed from "12/32/2021" to "1/1/2022".

Both line and branch coverage for GTv1 remained the same, while MTv1 line coverage increased from 66% to 73%
(branch coverage increased only by 1%).

2.2
After correcting the faulty line of code that caused "testDecemberToJanuary" to fail, we now have NDv21.
The newly generated test suite GTv12 has higher coverage compared to the previous GTv1:
line coverage is now 100% (12% higher) and branch coverage is 98% (5% higher). The number of tests in the test suite
increased by 1 and all 23 tests pass.
Equivalence classes covered by GTv12 are EC1, EC2, EC3, EC4, EC5, EC6, EC7, EC8, EC9, EC10, EC11,
meaning it covers two additional classes compared to GTv1: EC10 and EC11.
This actually gives more incorrect outputs without marking them as invalid, but then again the program tested is faulty.
However, that means it is now easier for the human tester to find those faults when inspecting the generated tests
since these now have a wider range of values.
